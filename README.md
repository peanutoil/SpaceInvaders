# SpaceInvaders
Play it here: https://replit.com/@HariniB/spacegame?v=1
Made using python and pygame. just uploading here to clear space bc this one takes up a lot of space. if you want to see the homescreen you need the following files: spacemenu.py, SPACE-INVADERS.png, START-GAME.png, QUIT.png, INSTRUCTIONS.png, SHOP.png, coin1.png, coin2.png etc. till coin6.png lol and then playingwithfire.mp3. up and down arrows keys to select, enter to enter but don't try to enter without all the files or it'll crash. it's a lot of files ik i just had wayy too much fun with the fancy pixel art text generators or whatever. i spent so long editing these on photopea too

features a shop to purchase music for the game also that is functioning! mostly. 

not fully functioning BUT the homescreen animations r kinda sick ngl im still proud of them. this was attempted in middle school mb i'll finish it one day
